These are the requirements of my simple blog application.
1. dowload the FloresBlog zipped file on github.
2. extract that in xampp/htdocs/
3. make a new folder in xampp/mysql/data/ and name it as FloresBlog (this folder is for importing my database).

5. import the flores_db_blog.sql(which is found in my FloresBlog folder) in the database that you have created in number 3.
6. after importing, go to localhost/FloresBlog
7. (if it runs) click Blogerist and then click Login.
